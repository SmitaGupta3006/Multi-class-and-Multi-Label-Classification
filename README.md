# Multi-class-and-Multi-Label-Classification
•	Each instance has three labels and each label has multiple classes 

•	Trained an SVM for each of the labels, using Gaussian kernels and one versus all classifiers

•	Determine the weight of the SVM penalty and the width of the Gaussian Kernel using cross validation
